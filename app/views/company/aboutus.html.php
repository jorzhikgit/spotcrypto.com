<h2>About Us </h2>
<p><?=COMPANY_URL?> is a crypto currency exchange based in India. We are crypto currency enthusiasts who seek to provide a solid crypto/fiat currency exchange site. We have been inspired to provide this service by the launch of GreenCoinX (XGC) the world’s first identifiable crypto currency, which we believe will lead to worldwide acceptance of crypto currency. We provide the services of exchanging, buying and selling GreenCoinX for Bitcoin (BTC) or for Euro (EUR), US Dollar (USD), and Canadian Dollar (CAD).</p>
<p>The transformative nature of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology has now entered a new phase with the advent of GreenCoinX the identifiable crypto currency. We invite you to trade with us.</p>
