<li>We have advanced verification tools to try and detect if your account is compromised</li>
</ul>
					</li>

<li><h5>Automatic backup of the database once a day</h5>
<p>Once a day, the database of the platform is backed up, encrypted and compressed as an archive. The passwords of users it contains are hashed</p>
</li>
